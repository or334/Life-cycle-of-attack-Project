# Life Cycle of Attack &amp; Attack tools

The main goal of the project is to show how hackers think and act 
through what is known as the &quot;life cycle of attack,&quot; which is the way
hackers habitually base their malicious attacks, starting from the stage of
collecting information, through delivering the attack, and then, at the
final stage, launch it on the victim.

Due to rising cyber-attacks in the world, and a stunning ignorance about
it from the beginner programmers, our main goal was to show how to
easily carry out basic cyber-attacks that provide a great deal of
knowledge about the target we want to attack without doing too
complicated things.

For that cause we have created we created 6 assault tools, each of which
plays a different role. Some of the tools collect information about the
target, and some are attacking the target, with each tool taken from a
different stage in the life cycle of attack.

After presenting each attack tool and itâ€™s stage at the life cycle of attack,
we hope that we will be able to raise awareness of information security
among the students who will want to deal with it in the future.
